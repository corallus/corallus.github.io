After my bachelor in **computer science** I started doing a master at **EIT Digital**, an organization for European entrepreneurs driving digital innovation in **ICT & Entrepeneurship**. My first years' specialization is in **Service Design and Engineering**, which I have completed at Aalto University in Finland. My second years' specialization is **Service Oriented Business Process Management** at Eindhoven University of Technology. After passing all courses I dropped out during my masters' thesis to work as a self-employed web developer.
